          Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from
          working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the
          small town in Maine where she grew up — she graduated from college,
          moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a
          spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in
          Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.
