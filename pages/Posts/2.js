          In Reminders of Him, Kenna Rowan is a 26-year-old woman who has
          recently been released from prison after causing the death of her
          boyfriend, Scotty, in a drunk driving accident five years earlier. She
          returns to town in the hopes of regaining custody of her and Scotty's
          daughter who is being raised by Scotty's parents, the Landrys.

            A troubled young mother yearns for a shot at redemption in this
            heartbreaking yet hopeful story from #1 New York Times bestselling
            author Colleen Hoover. But the bridges Kenna burned are proving
            impossible to rebuild.
          </p>
          <p>
            After serving five years in prison for a tragic mistake, Kenna Rowan
            returns to the town where it all went wrong, hoping to reunite with
            her four-year-old daughter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone in her daughter’s life is determined to shut Kenna out, no
            matter how hard she works to prove herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only person who hasn’t closed the door on her completely is
            Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to
            Kenna’s daughter.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an
            important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of
            everyone important to them.
