          The story of this novel is set in locations such as rural Bihar, New
          Delhi, Patna, and New York. This is the story of a boy from Bihar who
          is on a quest to win over the girl he loves. In this book, Chetan
          Bhagat dives into the sentiments experienced by a backward rural boy
          who enrols himself at the prestigious English-medium St. Stephen’s
          College, New Delhi. He then falls in love with a classy
          English-speaking rich girl from Delhi. He has a major linguistic set
          back as he doesn't speak English well. The girl does not give in to
          his attempts but instead agrees to be his "half girlfriend”.
